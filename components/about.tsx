				<p className="mb-5">
					Iâ€™m Olutunde Solabi, a frontend-focused software engineer passionate
					about building intuitive and high-performing web applications. With
					expertise in React.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, and Next.js, I specialize
					in creating dynamic and user-friendly interfaces that enhance user
					experience.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-5">
					I have a strong track record of delivering scalable and maintainable
					frontend solutions, collaborating closely with UX/UI designers and
					product managers to translate complex business requirements into
					seamless interfaces. At OpenDesk, I developed sophisticated
					applications using React and TypeScript, focusing on reusable
					components and well-tested code, which significantly improved
					debugging efficiency.

					Previously, at Spursmb, I integrated Azure OpenAI services, automated
					notifications, and optimized data storage, enhancing the platformâ€™s
					overall performance. My experience spans working with Tailwind CSS,
					Material UI, Ant Design, and Redux, ensuring that designs are both
					functional and visually appealing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beyond coding, I thrive in cross-functional collaboration, agile
					environments, and driving projects to completion ahead of deadlines.

					frontend development. Letâ€™s build something great! ðŸš€
